HOW TO MAKE DATAPACKS
---------------------

1. Download the vanilla worldgen files for reference
    https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft_configs/comments/vid9b4/119_vanilla_worldgen_pack_with_dimension_files/

2. Create a new folder for your datapack containing:
    - data/minecraft/worldgen
    - pack.mcmeta (with the right format # for your MC version)

3. Decide what kind of data you want to change, eg. for worldgen:
    https://misode.github.io/worldgen/

4. Make 'replacement files' by mirroring the same file from the minecraft folder in your folder

4. Make the necessary changes, using the vanilla files and guides as reference

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1. Zip the contents of the parent folder (not the folder itself, but pack.mcmeta + data)

2. (When creating a new world) open: data packs -> open pack folder -> put .zip file into folder
    - Create the world

3. (When loading an existing world) open: %APPDATA% and find the save folder -> put .zip file into datapacks folder
    - Load the world (or type /reload in an running world)
